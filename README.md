# WEB-234 W16P01-FinalProject

___

Your final project is to create a simplified website and present this in a short recorded video presentation.  The intent of this site is to show off your PHP skills you have acquired this semester.  Pick an application to develop a website which does not include a shopping cart since we have pretty thoroughly covered that this semester.  In past semesters, submissions have included tour registration websites, fitness tracking and workout scheduler website, etc,

Be sure that if you include images in your website that you find images on public domain sites like pexel or unsplash that do not require attribution when using or snap some images with your phone for use on your site.  If you borrow any design or css styles from an existing website or free website template, you must indicate your source and credit them in final presentation (like if you just use the Murach textbook CSS files).

### Project Requirements

___

- Keep a log of activity as you complete your PHP website.  This should be updated every time you work on the project and submitted in the Project folder every week.  If there is no activity logged for a week, you project will not be evaluated to determine if the requested website percentage was completed for the week.
- Your final project should include at least four PHP web pages (not including any CSS, headers, external menu navigation, etc.)
- Use a MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework as demonstrated by the MyGuitar application. (Chapter 5)
- Place any common html content for this like the page headers and footers in separate files that are included.  Refactoring for reuse is big in programming and can even be achieved with some of our web user interface content.
- All data for your application must be stored in session variables instead of a database because we did not learn how to define our own database in this course.  Session management must be used (not optional) to add, update and remove some type of application data pertinent to your website.  (Chapter 12)
- Your application must include at least one function that utilizes a variable that is passed by reference. (Chapter 13)
- Your application must include at least one function that uses an optional parameter with a default value.  (Chapter 13)
- Your application must include at least one class in your application with some type of method to execute beyond the constructor. (Chapter 14)
- Your application should at minimum utilize one regular expression to Include suitable provisions for validating data.  Your application should also handle any error situations as well as any unhandled application exceptions that may occur. (Chapter 15)
- For 15 points Extra Credit: Include at least one page update using AJAX.

### Presentation Requirements

A short video demonstrating your working web application and covering a few items in a PowerPoint presentation.  The PowerPoint presentation should include the URL to the video if hosted externally or the relative path within your GitHub project solution if you choose to store your video in GitHub.  In your presentation, you should address areas where you encountered problems and how you overcame any issues, and any attribution for site ideas or css that you may have used in creating your presentation.  After covering these few items from your PowerPoint slide deck, you should demonstrate your working application. Many options are available for creating the presentation video.  If you do not have a specific software solution in mind, you can consider https://screencast-o-matic.com/.

### Commit Changes to Remote GitHub Repository

___

1. Your working code in the applicable folders (the initial project will provide the model and view folders and you may create as many folders as needed for your application).
2. Your PowerPoint presentation (which includes a hyperlink or relative link to your video presentation!!!) which is used in the video should be saved as a pdf file and saved in the "project" directory.  This is for the final submission.
3. Your project activity log in the "project" directory which should be updated weekly with your activity on the project.
